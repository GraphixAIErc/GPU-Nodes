### 2. GPU Node Selection
Explore and choose GPU nodes based on your workload needs. Graphix AI supports a variety of GPUs, each optimized for specific computational requirements. Available GPU specifications include:

| GPU Model                | Memory | CPU Cores | Upload Speed | Download Speed |
|--------------------------|--------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti | 4 GB  | 8 Cores   | 35 MB        | 86 MB          |
| NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060   | 12 GB | 12 Cores  | 54 MB        | 76 MB          |
| NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070   | 8 GB  | 8 Cores   | 407 MB       | 411 MB         |
| NVIDIA RTX A4000          | 16 GB | 64 Cores  | 1122 MB      | 2055 MB        |

**Select a GPU that aligns with your project's performance and budgetary needs.**

### 3. Rental Duration
Define the rental duration according to your project timeline. The platform offers flexibility for short-term computational bursts or long-term intensive workloads.

---

### 4. ETH Payment
Review your selected GPU node and duration. Complete the transaction seamlessly using Ethereum (ETH). All payments are processed securely on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and efficiency.

---

### 5. Access Your Rented Node
Once the payment is verified, your rented node will appear in the **Transaction** dashboard. Initial setup may take a few minutes to provision the system

---

### 6. Retrieve Access Credentials
Navigate to the **Renting** section and select your active session. Unique login credentials will be generated for secure access.

---

### 7. Terminal Access
Use the provided terminal commands to establish an SSH connection with the rented GPU node. This enables full control for initiating computational tasks like training deep learning models, rendering 3D graphics, or executing data-intensive simulations.

---

### 8. Decentralized Contribution via CLI
If you have spare GPU capacity, you can contribute to the decentralized network by lending out your GPU resources through the <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Graphix AI Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> By leveraging this tool, you can securely lend GPU power to support various computational tasks and earn revenue while contributing to decentralized computing.

### Additional Notes
Ensure a stable internet connection during the node operation.
